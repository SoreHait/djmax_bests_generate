# DJMAX TOP 100 IMAGE GENERATOR

the only function you should care: `generate.generate_bests(...)`

this library connects to v-archive as data source

also read the comments above that function and maybe adapt the alternative function as needed

but it will dramatically extend the data fetching time because it will fetch all scores instead of fetching top boards
